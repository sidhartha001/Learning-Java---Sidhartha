           : What Parents Should Do About Allowances :
Parents have a lot of important decisions to make with regard to their kids.
One decision that’s sometimes overlooked, although still important, is 
whether or not to give an allowance. Establishing a system for an 
allowance may not work for every family, so there are some things 
to consider when deciding if you should give one to your child.
Receiving an allowance lets your children start to understand how 
money works and gives them a chance to learn and practice financial 
strategies for the future.

Children don’t necessarily deserve allowance from their parents, but 
tying it to chores in some way lets you start teaching them about 
finances while avoiding a sense of entitlement.An allowance can teach
kids about finances, responsibility and the consequences of poor 
financial decisions.If the allowance is tied to chores, kids learn
the relationship between work and pay. Helping your child understand
the correlation between work and reward will set them up for their 
future careers.If you require donating as part of your allowance system,
this can teach your kids the importance of giving to those who are 
less fortunate.

Even though an allowance can be a great teaching tool, there are some downsides.
An allowance may undermine the importance of contributing to the family. 
Your kids may get the perception that duties always deserve a reward instead
of simply doing their share for the family.
An allowance may open the door to kids making poor financial decisions
when spending their money.
